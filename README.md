# invoke-training

A library for training custom Stable Diffusion models (fine-tuning, LoRA training, textual inversion, etc.) that can be used in [InvokeAI](https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI).

> [!WARNING] > `invoke-training` is still under active development, and breaking changes are likely. Full backwards compatibility will not be guaranteed until v1.0.0.
> In the meantime, I recommend pinning to a specific commit hash.

## Installation

See the [Installation](https://invoke-ai.github.io/invoke-training/get-started/installation/) section of the documentation.

## Quick Start

`invoke-training` pipelines can be configured and launched from either the CLI or the GUI.

### CLI

Run training via the CLI with type-checked YAML configuration files for maximum control:

```bash
invoke-train --cfg-file src/invoke_training/sample_configs/sdxl_textual_inversion_gnome_1x24gb.yaml
```

### GUI

Run training via the GUI for a simpler starting point.

```bash
invoke-train-ui

# Or, you can optionally override the default host and port:
invoke-train-ui --host 0.0.0.0 --port 1234
```

## Features

Training progress can be monitored with [Tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard):

All trained models are compatible with InvokeAI:
